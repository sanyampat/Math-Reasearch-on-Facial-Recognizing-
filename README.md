[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

A research project exploring mathematical models and algorithms for facial recognition systems.

## üìñ Description
This repository contains ongoing research into the mathematical foundations of facial recognition technologies. We investigate various algorithms, dimensionality reduction techniques, and pattern recognition methods including but not limited to:
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Neural Network architectures
- Geometric transformation models

The project is currently in its early research phase, focusing on mathematical derivations and algorithmic implementations.

## ‚ú® Features
- Mathematical proofs and derivations for recognition algorithms
- Jupyter notebooks with prototype implementations
- Sample datasets for testing
- Comparative analysis of different mathematical approaches
- Visualization tools for feature space analysis

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation
